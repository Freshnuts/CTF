Project one is representative of what you might see in the average 200 point
CTF challenge. There is no source provided and you’re expected to do some
reverse engineering with IDA. Through reversing and playing around with the
challenge, you will likely find the issues and vulnerabilities you can leverage
to take control of the challenge.

The end goal is like any of labs. There’s a secret .pass file in the privileged
project1 account, and we would like you to extract it.

Good luck.
