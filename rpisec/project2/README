There are a few different stages to this project. There is no source, so you
will be required to do some reversing. Using IDA is HIGHLY advised.

Ultimately, this is an exploitation challenge. There is a .pass file, and you
are expected to get a shell as with the labs or last project.

The service is running on port 31337
