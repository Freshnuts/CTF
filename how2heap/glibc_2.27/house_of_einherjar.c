   Credit to st4g3r for publishing this technique
   The House of Einherjar uses an off-by-one overflow with a null byte to control the pointers returned by malloc()
   This technique may result in a more powerful primitive than the Poison Null Byte, but it has the additional requirement of a heap leak.
