	The main goal of this technique is to create a **leakless** heap 
	exploitation technique in order to get a shell. This is mainly 
	done using **relative overwrites** in order to get pointers in 
	the proper locations without knowing the exact value of the pointer.

	The first step is to get a pointer inside of __malloc_hook. This 
	is done by creating a fastbin bin that looks like the following: 
	ptr_to_chunk -> ptr_to_libc. Then, we alter the ptr_to_libc
	 (with a relative overwrite) to point to __malloc_hook. 
			
	The next step is to run an unsorted bin attack on the __malloc_hook 
	(which is now controllable from the previous attack).  Again, we run 
	the unsorted_bin attack by altering the chunk->bk with a relative overwrite. 

	Finally, after launching the unsorted_bin attack to put a libc value 
	inside of __malloc_hook, we use another relative overwrite on the 
	value of __malloc_hook to point to a one_gadget, system or some other function.
	
	Now, the next time we run malloc we pop a shell! :) 
	However, this does come at a cost: 12 bits of randomness must be 
	brute forced (0.02% chance) of working.

	 https://gist.github.com/romanking98/9aab2804832c0fb46615f025e8ffb0bc#assumptions.





	This technique requires the ability to edit fastbin and unsorted bin 
	pointers via UAF or overflow of some kind. Additionally, good control 
	over the allocations sizes and freeing is required for this technique.

	Part 1: Fastbin Chunk points to __malloc_hook

	Getting the main_arena in a fastbin chunk ordering is the first step.
	This requires a ton of heap feng shui in order to line this up properly. 
	However, at a glance, it looks like the following:

	First, we need to get a chunk that is in the fastbin with a pointer to
	a heap chunk in the fd. 
	Second, we point this chunk to a pointer to LibC (in another heap chunk). 
	All of the setup below is in order to get the configuration mentioned 
	above setup to perform the relative overwrites. ";


	Getting the pointer to libC can be done in two ways: 
			- A split from a chunk in the small/large/unsorted_bins 
				gets allocated to a size of 0x70. 
			- Overwrite the size of a small/large chunk used previously to 0x71.

	For the sake of example, this uses the first option because it 
	requires less vulnerabilities.

	/*

	Now, we start doing the relative overwrites, since that we have 
	the pointers in their proper locations. The layout is very important to 
	understand for this.

	Current heap layout: 
	0x0:   fastbin_victim       - size 0x70 
	0x70:  alignment_filler     - size 0x90
	0x100: fake_libc_chunk      - size 0x70

	0x190: relative_offset_heap - size 0x70 

	bin layout: 
			fastbin:  fastbin_victim -> relative_offset_heap
			unsorted: leftover_main
	
	Now, the relative overwriting begins:
	Recall that fastbin_victim points to relative_offset_heap 
	(which is in the 0x100-0x200 offset range). The fastbin uses a singly 
	linked list, with the next chunk in the 'fd' slot.

	By *partially* editing the fastbin_victim's last byte (from 0x90 
	to 0x00) we have moved the fd pointer of fastbin_victim to 
	fake_libc_chunk (at offset 0x100).

	Also, recall that fake_libc_chunk had previously been in the unsorted_bin. 
	Because of this, it has a fd pointer that points to main_arena + 0x68. 

	Now, the fastbin looks like the following: 
	fastbin_victim -> fake_libc_chunk ->(main_arena + 0x68).


	The relative overwrites (mentioned above) will be demonstrates step by step below.

	/*

			0x70: fastbin_victim -> fake_libc_chunk -> (main_arena + 0x68)
	
	We want the fd ptr in fake_libc_chunk to point to something useful. 
	So, let's edit this to point to the location of the __malloc_hook. 
	This way, we can get control of a function ptr.

	To do this, we need a valid malloc size. Within the __memalign_hook 
	is usually an address that usually starts with 0x7f. 
	Because __memalign_hook value is right before this are all 0s, 
	we could use a misaligned chunk to get this to work as a valid size in 
	the 0x70 fastbin.

	This is where the first 4 bits of randomness come into play. 
	The first 12 bits of the LibC address are deterministic for the address. 
	However, the next 4 (for a total of 2 bytes) are not. 
	
	So, we have to brute force 2^4 different possibilities (16) 
	in order to get this in the correct location. This 'location' 
	is different for each version of GLibC (should be noted).

	Part 2: Unsorted_bin attack 

	Now, we have control over the location of the __malloc_hook. 
	However, we do not know the address of LibC still. So, we cannot 
	do much with this attack. In order to pop a shell, we need 
	to get an address at the location of the __malloc_hook.

	We will use the unsorted_bin attack in order to change the value 
	of the __malloc_hook with the address of main_arena + 0x68. 
	For more information on the unsorted_bin attack, review 
	https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap/blob/master/glibc_2.26/unsorted_bin_attack.c.

	For a brief overview, the unsorted_bin attack allows us to write
	main_arena + 0x68 to any location by altering the chunk->bk of
	an unsorted_bin chunk. We will choose to write this to the 
	location of __malloc_hook.

	After we overwrite __malloc_hook with the main_arena, we will 
	edit the pointer (with a relative overwrite) to point to a 
	one_gadget for immediate code execution.
			
	Again, this relative overwrite works well but requires an additional 
	1 byte (8 bits) of brute force.
	This brings the chances of a successful attempt up to 12 bits of 
	randomness. This has about a 1/4096 or a 0.0244% chance of working.
